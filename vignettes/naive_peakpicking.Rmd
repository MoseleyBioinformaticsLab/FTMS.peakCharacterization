## Data

Replication study using BCAL breast cancer samples and various normal samples.

This is using one of the most naive methods of peak picking, in that we take
the mzML files that have already had their scans filtered by time.

RAW files were converted using `msconvert` in `/home/rmflight/Music/big_data_notbackup/CESB/rawdata/replication_study`

```
msconvert *.RAW -o ../mzml_files --filter "scanTime [18,430]"
```
