# FTMS.peakCharacterization


The goal of the FTMS.peakCharacterization package is to facilitate scan-centric peak characterization of profile level, multi-scan, direct-injection Fourier-transform mass spectrometry data.

You can read more about the merits of this scan-centric method in:

## Installation

**Warning**: The authors of this package have not gone through and updated the dependencies for this package for a while.
Therefore, when installing right now, you will likely get messages about missing dependencies.
Please feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/MoseleyBioinformaticsLab/FTMS.peakCharacterization/issues) if you need help getting it up and running.
This situation should be remedied shortly.

You can install the development version of FTMS.peakCharacterization from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("MoseleyBioinformaticsLab/FTMS.peakCharacterization")
```

## Example

We are lacking basic examples at the moment.
We are hoping to get some basic example and more documentation of the functionality in here shortly.
